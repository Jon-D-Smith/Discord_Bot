# Discord_Bot
This bot was built to keep track of Dogecoin prices with my discord server. Whent he !doge command is called, the bot will hit an api to get the most recent Dogecoin prices and return the price in the dirscord chat. 

## Commands 
!much-help - This command will give you a list of commands in the Discord chat.

!doge - This command will give you the current price of Dogecoin compared to the last time you asked.

## Future Plans
Right now this bot has little demand as the dogecoin hype has died down a little bit. I may revisit this in the future and remake it into a crypto bot that can return the crypto for several types of coins.
